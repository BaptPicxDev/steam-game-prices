picard.baptiste@laposte.net

This project provides you some tools to retrieve Steam App Ids (like Games, DLCs, BO)
and Steam App's prices over the time.

Before use : 
- Take care about the main.py file. In this file you could set-up the projet.
- Change the environnement variables (RASP=False)

To run it : 
sudo docker build -t image_name .

To solve : 
- pandas could not be improt for the moment in the requirements.txt
- Webscrapping doesn't work yet.
